 PMG_Assignment

Furthermore, upon examination of the campaign_info.csv, it was observed that the 'revenue' column is not present, though it was accounted for in the original table creation script.
Consequently, this column has been omitted from the refined schema.
Comments within the code provide further clarity on these changes.

The results and additional explanations are put in the docx called Supplementary Documentation.docx
